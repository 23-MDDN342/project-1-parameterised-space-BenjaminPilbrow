### 2023 MDDN342 Project 1: Parameterised Space

Been working for the past week in my own file just to get the Matrix effect working outside of the framework. There was a great The Coding Train video (https://youtu.be/S1TQCi9axzg) on creating a similar effect, so I used that as a base. 

Once I had finished following along with the video and messing around with a few sections myself, I finally transfered the code over into the Project 1 framework. Without much success...

Had a few major issues initially, I had to change a few variable names, change a function name from "draw" to "draw_one_frame", and so on. Still no success. Thankfully our wonderful guardian angel Phoebe came in to save the day, replacing the "setup" function (as the framework already does that), checking if all the functions are actually called, finding a place where I had mispelled a variable name which was causing the code to break, and so on.

Now it works! Thanks Phoebe! There is still a lot of work to be done in terms of updating the code and making the output a little more interesting, but this is a great base. Firstly I need to make sure the animation actually loops within 24 frames, then I will add options for changing the colours and maybe the symbols into differnt shapes...?
