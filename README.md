### 2023 MDDN342 Project 1: Parameterised Space

MDDN342 - Project 1 - MATRIX RAINING TEXT ZOOM BACKGROUND

INTRODUCTION
For Project 1 of Creative Coding 3, I decided to recreate the "Matrix Raining Text" animation effect using a p5.js sketch, with the intent to produce an animated Zoom background that seamlessly loops every 1 second. I have parameterised it to work at any scale, with options to easily change the colours, speed, and amount of characters per stream, along with a plethora of other additions. 


GOALS
My goals for this project were simple: create a parameterised looping 1 second animation in the style of The Matrix that I can use as a Zoom background, with a options to customise the design (as outlined above).


PROCESS
Starting out, I knew what effect I wanted to achieve, however I didn't know exactly where to start. This is where some internet searching helped. Orginally, I asked ChatGPT for some guidance on how I would go about creating an animation like this, and it provided me with some code that got me on (somewhat) of the right track. The code was completely broken however, so I stashed that work and started again. Next I stumbled across a fantastic video by The Coding Train (https://youtu.be/S1TQCi9axzg), which helped me to get a great head start on how to lay out my code. 

Of course, the framework we were working within for the project ment I couldn't simply copy all my work over from the video, and I spent a fair amount of time trying to get the animation running within the framework. Eventually, with some help from Phoebe, I got it working and was able to start refining it down.

The key areas I focused on were making it actually loop, adjust how the text size was set (as it wasn't scaling correctly), adding options for changing colours, and more. After a number of iterations (see the Progress Document), I ended up with a design I am rather pleased with. 


FINAL THOUGHTS
Overall I enjoyed the simple nature of my design in this project. While at times the design was quite limiting, it was a fun challange to get it all working within the framework and I find the final output to be very satisfying to look at for extended periods of time.
