### 2023 MDDN342 Project 1: Parameterised Space

Added a background stream into the code, with a lower brightness and smaller font size. Also made the font size / by the width, so that it stays the same no matter what size the canvas is. Next I'll mess around with making the background colour chnage slightly with the hue of the text, so we'll see how that goes!
